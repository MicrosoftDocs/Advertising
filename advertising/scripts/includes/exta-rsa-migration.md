> [!NOTE]
>
> * Starting sometime next year, you'll no longer be able to create new or edit existing expanded text ads. **Please create responsive search ads from now on**. For more information, see [About responsive search ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60037).
> * Existing expanded text ads will continue to serve, and you'll be able to view reports on their performance.  
> * You'll still be able to pause, enable, or remove your expanded text ads. Otherwise, attempts to add or update expanded text ads will result in a `CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid` error.
> * [Learn more about this change](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/august-2022/you-have-5-additional-months-to-migrate-to-responsive-search-ads-deadline-extended-to-february-1-2023).
