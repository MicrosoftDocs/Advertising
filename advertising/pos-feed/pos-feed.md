# Landing pages feed (formerly Points of sale (POS) feed)

If you create hotel price ads in Bing, you must use a Landing pages feed to provide Bing information about the sites that users use to book rooms. You must define and import your Landing pages feed prior to sending Bing [Price feeds](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md).

To provide Bing your Landing pages, create an XML document that contains the list of sites that users use to book rooms. A point of sale describes its name, matching criteria, and URL. For information about creating the XML document, see the following topics.
