# Data Clean Room

Data clean room integration is a cutting-edge initiative by Microsoft Advertising, designed to empower enterprise customers with secure, privacy-compliant data collaboration capabilities. Developed in partnership with LiveRamp (formerly Habu Clean Room), this solution enables advertisers to seamlessly combine their first-party data with Microsoftâ€™s proprietary signals, including Search and Audience impressions from MSAP, within a protected data clean room environment.  

By leveraging Spark SQL queries, advertisers and agencies can generate advanced cross-platform measurement reports and build custom audiences for activation via the MSAP Customer Match API. The data clean room ensures that all data processing occurs in a privacy-safe context, with outputs delivered in aggregate to safeguard user-level information.  

This integration supports a wide range of use cases, including audience insights, measurement, and audience activation.
