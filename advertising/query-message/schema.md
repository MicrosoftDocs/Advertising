# Query message schema

The Query XSD defines the schema used by Bing Hotel API's Query message. The schema defines the objects Bing uses to specify the Query messages that it sends you to get your itinerary updates. For information about the objects and elements that define a Query message, see [Query Message Reference](../query-message/reference.md).

The following is the XSD that defines query messages.

- [query.xsd](https://bhacstatic.z22.web.core.windows.net/schemas/query.xsd)

For information about processing query messages, see [Processing a Query Message](../query-message/process-query-message.md).
