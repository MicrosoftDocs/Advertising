# Ad Group Job Function Criterion Record - Bulk
Defines an ad group job function criterion that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file. 

You can target people in a specific job function according to LinkedIn by setting the [Profile Id](#profileid). 

Microsoft Advertising applies a union of both campaign and ad group level profile criterions. However, if you apply a criterion with the same profile ID e.g., target or exclude the same company name at both the campaign and ad group level, then the ad group level criterion will override the campaign level criterion. 

> [!TIP]
> For an overview of how to use target criterions, see [Show Ads to Your Target Audience](../guides/show-ads-target-audience.md).

You can download all *Ad Group Job Function Criterion* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroupTargetCriterions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group job function criterion if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Bid Adjustment,Name,Profile Id,
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,
Ad Group Job Function Criterion,Active,,-1111,,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,20,,ProfileIdGoesHere,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkAdGroupJobFunctionCriterion* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAdGroupJobFunctionCriterion
var bulkAdGroupJobFunctionCriterion = new BulkAdGroupJobFunctionCriterion
{
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    AdGroupName = null,

    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    CampaignName = null,

    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // 'Profile' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    ProfileName = null,

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // BiddableAdGroupCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.

    BiddableAdGroupCriterion = new BiddableAdGroupCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,

        Criterion = new ProfileCriterion
        {
            // 'Profile Id' column header in the Bulk file
            ProfileId = 0,

            // Maps to the 'Ad Group Job Function Criterion' record name in the Bulk file
            ProfileType = ProfileType.JobFunction
        },

        CriterionBid = new BidMultiplier
        {
            // 'Bid Adjustment' column header in the Bulk file
            Multiplier = 20,
        },

        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdGroupCriterionStatus.Active,
    }
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAdGroupJobFunctionCriterion);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
