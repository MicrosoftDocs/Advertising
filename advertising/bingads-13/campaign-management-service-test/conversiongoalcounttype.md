# ConversionGoalCountType Value Set Test - Campaign Management
Defines how your conversions are recorded within your chosen conversion window.

For example, you track two conversions: leads and sales. You pick *Unique* for leads and *All* for sales. When one ad click turns into two leads and two sales, it's counted as three conversions: one for the unique lead, and two for all the sales. 

## Syntax
```xml
<xs:simpleType name="ConversionGoalCountType" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
    <xs:enumeration value="All" />
    <xs:enumeration value="Unique" />
  </xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>
```
