# Hotel price ads

Lodging campaigns is a new campaign type that enables advertisers to showcase their hotels on Bing.com across devices. Travelers can see [Hotel price ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56880/1) when they are actively looking to book a hotel. In addition to the Hotel price ads, lodging campaigns allow advertisers to display their hotels on the Bing Maps page via the [Property promotion ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en/60173).
